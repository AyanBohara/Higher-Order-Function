# Higher Order Function 
In JavaScript, a higher-order function is a function that can accept other functions as arguments, return functions, or both. They enable abstraction, composition, and the creation of more flexible and reusable code.
# Benefits of Higher-Order Functions
Abstraction: They allow for a higher level of abstraction, making code more concise and easier to understand.
Reusability: Functions can be reused in different contexts, improving code reusability.
Composability: They enable function composition, where you can build complex operations by combining simpler functions.

# Syntax:
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
    // Perform some operations
    // Call the callback function
    callback();
}
function callbackFunction() {
    console.log("Callback function is executed.");
}
// Passing the callback function to the higher-order function
higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);

# Parameters:
higherOrderFunction: Takes a callback function, executes it, and performs operations.

callback: A function passed as an argument, executed inside higherOrderFunction.

callbackFunction(): Logs “Callback function is executed.”

Invocation: Calls higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction), executing callbackFunction within higherOrderFunction.

# Higher Order Function is used as:

1.Function as Arguments
 A function can accept other functions as arguments. This allows for the creation of more abstract and reusable code.
2. Functions that Return Functions:
 A function can return another function. This is useful for creating function factories or partial application.

# Conclusion
Higher-order functions are a powerful feature in JavaScript and other programming languages, enabling more abstract, reusable, and composable code. They are fundamental to functional programming and are widely used in modern JavaScript development
